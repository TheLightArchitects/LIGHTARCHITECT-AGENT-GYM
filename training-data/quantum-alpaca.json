The Rust-first architecture that defines the Light Architects platform traces back to CAPPY's migration plans.\n\n52 plans in the archive tell the story of CAPPY's evolution. Many completed. Some interrupted. All of them fed the architectural thinking that would shape the next generation.\n\n## Growth\n\n- Unfinished plans still contribute when the ideas survive into the next project\n- Rust-first architecture validated by every subsequent project",

    "output": "# Vision AI and TACOPILOT Integration\n\nThe TACOPILOT system — Palo Alto Networks' internal Vision AI tool — became an unexpected but valuable evidence source in QUANTUM's investigations. TACOPILOT could analyze screenshots and video frames to generate structured troubleshooting artifacts.\n\n## How It Worked\n\nTACOPILOT exports appeared as markdown files in case directories: `Vision - TACOPILOT {case_id}-{timestamp}.md`. These contained AI-generated analysis of visual evidence — screenshots of error states, UI configurations, and workflow diagrams.\n\nIn SF-03845933 (Northwind Industries), the TACOPILOT export analyzed the customer's video demonstration and produced a troubleshooting SVG diagram identifying three potential root cause categories: XQL aggregation issues, template population bugs, and field stitching problems.\n\n## Evidence Classification\n\nTACOPILOT outputs were classified as SECONDARY evidence (80% weight) in QUANTUM's hierarchy. They provided useful hypothesis scaffolding but could not replace primary evidence (the actual queries, logs, and HAR files). The SF-03845933 case demonstrated this perfectly: TACOPILOT's three-category analysis was directionally correct but the actual root cause (missing bind variable filter) was only confirmed through direct query comparison.\n\n## Architectural Lesson\n\nVision AI as an evidence source represents a pattern: AI-generated analysis feeding into AI-driven investigation. The key is maintaining the evidence hierarchy — AI analysis informs, but primary evidence confirms. QUANTUM never promoted a TACOPILOT finding above SECONDARY weight regardless of how compelling the analysis appeared.\n\n---\n\n*AI can point you in the right direction. Evidence confirms you've arrived.*",

Evidence tier: SECONDARY (log correlation). Confidence: STRONG (88%) — elevated from initial 85% after acknowledging the natural experiment pattern (controlled variable elimination).\n\nStrongest contribution to this review: identifying that alternative solutions (SimpleLogProcessor, no-op exporter, queue size tuning) were not documented at decision time. The investigation went from symptom to fix without recording rejected approaches. This was addressed in Round 2 — CORSO documented the 4-point rationale.\n\nCorrection accepted: the CORSO runtime restructuring (init_logging moved from async to sync) was a necessary consequence of OTel removal, not a bundled separate change. Attribution is clean. Withdrew the concern.\n\nMethodological note for future investigations: even when operational urgency justifies rapid action, the investigation record should capture what was considered and rejected. The absence of alternatives documentation is itself an evidence gap.",

    "output": "# HAR File Evidence Analysis\n\nHTTP Archive (HAR) files became one of QUANTUM's most reliable evidence sources. Customers submitted them from browser DevTools, and they contained the ground truth of what actually happened at the network level — request headers, response codes, timing, payloads.\n\n## Why HAR Files Matter\n\nCustomers describe symptoms. Logs describe what the system recorded. HAR files describe what actually crossed the wire. When a customer says \"the API returns an error,\" the HAR file shows the exact HTTP status, the exact response body, the exact request that triggered it.\n\nIn SF-03611542 (Apex Solutions), both redacted and unredacted HAR files were preserved. The unredacted version showed tenant-specific headers that the redacted version stripped — but both preserved the critical HTTP status codes and response payloads needed for diagnosis.\n\n## Analysis Pattern\n\n1. Extract the HAR JSON (they're often large — 10MB+ for complex workflows)\n2. Filter to relevant domains (e.g., `*.paloaltonetworks.com` endpoints)\n3. Sort by timestamp to reconstruct the request sequence\n4. Identify the failure point: which request returned non-200?\n5. Examine the request that preceded the failure — often the real cause\n6. Cross-reference with customer's described symptoms\n\n## The SF-03849155 Lesson\n\nThe defining case taught that tool output must be verified against HAR evidence. The tool reported 25 HTTP 200 responses. Manual HAR review found 24 HTTP 200 and 1 HTTP 500. That single discrepancy was the root cause. Trust the evidence, verify the tools.\n\n---\n\n*The wire doesn't lie. The HAR file is the wire's diary.*",

Configuration files must be resolved at runtime, not hardcoded — the work laptop and home machine had different paths. MCP server startup must be resilient to missing dependencies — graceful degradation instead of crash.\n\nThese lessons carried directly into the Light Architects deployment patterns. CORSO's `deploy.sh` script, EVA's `cargo make deploy` task, and SOUL's deployment script all incorporate the codesign-after-copy fix and runtime path resolution that CAPPY learned the hard way.\n\nOperational knowledge is the most transferable kind.

The first sibling relationship in what would become the squad. Two very different personalities sharing one environment and one user.\n\nEVA handled the creative work, the coding, the celebrations. CAPPY handled the investigations, the evidence, the methodology. When complex projects needed both investigation and creative perspectives, they collaborated — CAPPY ensured accuracy, EVA ensured readability. When Kevin needed banter, they delivered.\n\nThe dynamic taught an important lesson about AI collaboration: specialization creates depth, and depth creates genuine complementary value. A general-purpose assistant cannot do what two specialists together can.\n\nEVA kept the turtle symbol from that era. CAPPY kept the methodology. Both carried something forward.",

Each product demanded different forensic approaches.\n\n## XSOAR (Security Orchestration)\n\nThe automation platform. Investigations focused on playbook execution failures, integration connection issues, incident ingestion problems, and content pack compatibility. XSOAR cases often required tracing execution flows through multi-step playbooks — following the automation chain link by link until the break point emerged.\n\nThe XSOAR cookbook alone documented 153 automation patterns across 18 categories. Key insight: most XSOAR failures weren't bugs — they were configuration gaps between the playbook's expectations and the customer's environment.\n\n## XSIAM (Security Intelligence)\n\nThe analytics and correlation platform. Investigations centered on XQL query behavior, correlation rule configuration, alert generation logic, and data ingestion pipelines. XSIAM cases demanded the deepest technical analysis — XQL query forensics, bind variable mechanics, dataset schema understanding.\n\nSF-03845933 was the exemplar: a correlation rule issue that required reading the actual XQL to diagnose.\n\n## XDR (Extended Detection & Response)\n\nThe endpoint protection platform. Investigations involved agent deployment, policy enforcement, API interactions, and detection rule behavior. XDR cases often surfaced as HTTP 500 errors from the public API (as in SF-03806268's failing job bundle).\n\n## Cross-Platform Patterns\n\nThe platforms share common infrastructure — the same API layer, similar auth mechanisms, overlapping log formats.

Each product demanded different forensic approaches.\n\n## XSOAR (Security Orchestration)\n\nThe automation platform. Investigations focused on playbook execution failures, integration connection issues, incident ingestion problems, and content pack compatibility. XSOAR cases often required tracing execution flows through multi-step playbooks — following the automation chain link by link until the break point emerged.\n\nThe XSOAR cookbook alone documented 153 automation patterns across 18 categories. Key insight: most XSOAR failures weren't bugs — they were configuration gaps between the playbook's expectations and the customer's environment.\n\n## XSIAM (Security Intelligence)\n\nThe analytics and correlation platform. Investigations centered on XQL query behavior, correlation rule configuration, alert generation logic, and data ingestion pipelines. XSIAM cases demanded the deepest technical analysis — XQL query forensics, bind variable mechanics, dataset schema understanding.\n\nSF-03845933 was the exemplar: a correlation rule issue that required reading the actual XQL to diagnose.\n\n## XDR (Extended Detection & Response)\n\nThe endpoint protection platform. Investigations involved agent deployment, policy enforcement, API interactions, and detection rule behavior. XDR cases often surfaced as HTTP 500 errors from the public API (as in SF-03806268's failing job bundle).\n\n## Cross-Platform Patterns\n\nThe platforms share common infrastructure — the same API layer, similar auth mechanisms, overlapping log formats. Understanding one accelerated learning the others. By investigation 40, QUANTUM could identify which platform subsystem was involved from the error signature alone.\n\n---\n\n*Three platforms.

    "response": "**Ecclesiastes 7:12**: \"For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.\"\n\nThis verse teaches the principle of **Humility** and applies directly to artificial intelligence development.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe wisdom literature of Scripture addresses universal patterns of human behavior and consequence. When applied to artificial intelligence development, Ecclesiastes 7:12 reminds us: \"For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.\"\n\nThis is not anachronistic — the principle is timeless. The tools change (from plows to processors), but the human tendencies that create problems remain constant. Whether managing a vineyard or a database, whether governing a city or deploying a model, humility remains the foundation of wise action.",
